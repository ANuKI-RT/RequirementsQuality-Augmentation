## Getting started

This method was developed for conducting the experiment for AIAugmentation-Bachelor-Thesis-2023

Some methods to support the evaluation of the samples generated by the main aiaugmentation software. 

You can access cli-methods by typing: python cli.py -m "METHOD" -i "INPUT"

to find out which methods are available, type: python cli.py -h

The method evaluate_experiment requires you to pass a file as an argument. The file should be placed in data/output, as this directory will be scanned for your file.
Just pass the filename with extension (e.g. "text.json"), the algorithm will take care of the rest.

after conducting an experiment, the result will be placed inside data/output/evaluated
the method calc_evaluate_experiment takes a filename with extension as an input and will search through this directory to find the coresponding file.
