        "The following definitions apply to the ETCS application levels: -Level 0: ETCS active for restricted train control function; track side without train control system or equipped with a train control system for which no STM is available on board. -Level 1: Basic track for training information on intermittent transmission media, e.g. balises. This information can be supported by filling, transmission via balise, loop or radio. -Level 2: Basic track for training and training information on continuous transmission media, i.e. radio. Train identification is carried out on track side. -Level 3: Like Level 2, except that train integrity is provided from board and thus from track side."
