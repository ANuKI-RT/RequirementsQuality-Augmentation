For certain functions, standardised telephone numbers shall be implemented. These functions are: -Route call to most appropriate ERTMS/ETCS RBC; -Railway emergency call; -Route call to primary controller; -Route call to secondary controller; -Route call to power supply controller; -Public emergency call.[END]
To provide interoperability between the fixed railway networks within the EIRENE network, standardisation of UIC group numbering will be required.[END]
In network boundary areas, the pre-defined local area shall be allocated on a bilateral basis.[END]
Authorised users within the EIRENE network shall be able to receive calls from calling parties outside the EIRENE network.[END]
In order to provide a consistent level of service in each railway network and, inparticular, to ensure interoperability for train drivers and other users roaming between networks, it is important to harmonise subscription details and other information stored in the network.[END]
For the purposes of defining common subscription profiles, a number of subscription types might be used, for example: -Cab radio; -on-train radio; -controller; -trackside worker; -general staff; -data services; -administration/management.[END]
A number of levels of priority shall be required in order to offer different grades ofservice to different users and calls. Five levels of priority shall be defined: -Railway emergency; -control-command (safety); -public emergency and group calls between drivers in the same area; -railway operation; -railway information.[END]
The lowest priority on going call shall be pre-empted before that of a higher priority.[END]
In the case where an EIRENE mobile attempts to make a Railway emergency call over a publicnetwork, the ability to pre-empt lower priority calls (particularly public emergency calls) may be inhibited, unless a special agreement is in place.[END]
Various types of call restriction may be employed by the railways as an additional security measure. Such facilities may be particularly important if public network access to the radio system is provided (eg to prevent members of the public calling drivers and drivers calling members of the public).[END]
Any implementation of such call restrictions shall not affect international interoperability.[END]
A mobile may be a member of a number of groups. It shall be possible to activate or deactivate the mobiles subscription to these groups.[END]
Activating a group on the mobile shall allow a user to receive a call from that group.[END]

Open indicates that permissions for calls of this type are to be assigned by the implementing railway according to their specific communication requirements.[END]
If required, a railway may make additional restrictions to the access matrix.[END]
There is a requirement to be able to address communications to a functional number rather than a telephone number. Such numbers are generally only associated with a user for a limited period of time.[END]
The addressing scheme can be divided into two areas: -functional addressing; -location dependent addressing.[END]
An addressing scheme shall be provided which permits users to be identified by numbers corresponding to their functional roles rather than by numbers tied to the terminal equipment that they are using.[END]
The primary usage of functional addressing will be for controllers to establish communications with train drivers by making use of the train number. The train number will vary between journeys although EIRENE equipment in the cab is unlikely to change.[END]
Other uses of functional addressing will include identifying on-train functions and other users performing particular roles such as shunting team leaders, maintenanceteam members, etc.[END]
It shall be possible to assign up to a minimum of 3 functional numbers to an EIRENE user at any one time.[END]
Only one EIRENE user shall be assigned to a given functional number at any one time.[END]
A user shall be able to set up a functional number on one network, and cancel the number from another network.[END]
The functional number shall remain valid as a user roams from one network to another.[END]
The functional addressing scheme shall be independent of specific configurations of mobile and terminal equipment. For example, the functional number of a conductor onboard a particular train shall be the same irrespective of whether the conductor accesses the network through the Cab radio or has a separate dedicated EIRENE mobile.[END]
It shall be possible to call EIRENE users by functional numbers from a wide range of terminals (EIRENE and non-EIRENE). Examples include EIRENE mobiles, controller terminals, railway fixed network telephones and public telephones. (All such calls will be subject to any access restrictions see section 10.3.).[END]
The functional addressing scheme should permit calls to be routed from a controller to an international train within the control area without reference to any EIRENE system other than that providing service to the international train.[END]
Functional numbers must be unique within the domain of operation. Since the number must be independent of networks, each number must be unique across all networks (including implementation of EIRENE facilities on public networks).[END]
The functional number shall consist of numeric characters only.[END]
If alpha numeric numbers are applied by a national railway, the railway will be responsible for the translation to unique numeric functional numbers compatible with the EIRENE specification.[END]
The functional identity of the called user shall be presented to the user initiating a call and the functional identity of the initiator shall be presented to the user receiving a call.[END]
For broadcast and group voice communications, the functional identity provided shall be that of the broadcast or group identity.[END]
If the user initiating the call has more than one functional identity, the user shall be able to select, prior to call establishment, which functional identity is presented to the receiving user.[END]
In the case of Cab radio, when a train number is assigned as a functional identity, this shall take priority over other Cab radio functional identities, and shall be the functional identity for the Cab radio to be displayed to other users.[END]
The functional identity shall be presented to the user in a form which can be readily understood (eg driver of train abcd rather than abcd01 or xyz shunting team 3 rather than xyz03).[END]
Three procedures can be identified for managing the relationship between the functional number and the telephone number by the mobile user as defined below.[END]
The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straight forward procedure for registration of functional numbers. This procedure shall be carried out by the user on commencement of the functional role.[END]
The functional number registration facility shall be supported by all EIRENE user equipment.[END]
It should be possible for the system to prevent certain types of users from registering functional numbers that they are not authorised to use, for example: -train number; -driver of train; -shunting team leader.[END]
It shall be possible to register up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds.[END]
The registration procedure shall provide a means to prevent mis-allocation of functional numbers during registration.[END]
Duplicate functional numbers (eg two trains with the same train number) shall be prevented.[END]
The system shall provide a means to recover consistent data sets following a system failure during which functional addressing facilities are lost. During this recovery period, the system shall not permit the use of unverified functional numbers.[END]
The functional addressing scheme shall be supported by a straight forward procedurefor deregistration of functional numbers. This procedure shall be carried out by the user at the end of the functional role.[END]
The functional number deregistration facility shall be supported by all EIRENE user equipment.[END]
It shall be possible to deregister up to ten functional numbers to items of equipment physically connected to the Cab radio within 30 seconds.[END]
In addition, a given set of users shall also be allowed to: -deregister a functional number which is no longer valid but which has not been deregistered by the user; -deregister, by overriding, another user of the same type (eg a driver can deregister a train number that another driver has forgotten to deregister); -deregister, with one action, all functional numbers associated with the same mobile (eg the driver deregisters all functions at the end of the journey).[END]
An EIRENE mobile shall remove the displayed functional number and provide an indication to the user that deregistration has taken place.[END]
To allow roaming between EIRENE networks, the system shall support a procedure for the re-registration of functional numbers after selection of a new network.[END]
This procedure shall be carried out without manual intervention.[END]
After automatic re-registration is performed, the new registration details shall be displayed to the user.[END]
Location dependent addressing shall be provided to route calls for a given function to a destination number that is dependent upon the users location.[END]
The functions to which calls shall be routed based upon the location of the mobile shall include: -Primary controller; -Secondary controller; -Power supply controller; -Train management centre (eg RBC, CTS).[END]
The correspondence between the locations and the destination of the call shall be easily re-configurable to support dynamic changes in controller are a boundaries (eg controller are a boundaries will change from peak to off-peak periods during the working day or over longer periods, areas may change to match changes in railway organisation or traffic demand).[END]
When operating with location dependent addressing, no manual action shall be required to update the system when a mobile moves between locations.[END]
The location dependent addressing scheme shall be available to all mobiles.[END]
As a minimum, the location information used by the EIRENE system shall be derived from that available from the network itself (eg current cell or base station serving the mobile).[END]
Where greater accuracy for location dependent addressing is required, additional location information may be provided by systems external to EIRENE. Sources of such information may include: a)ground-based signalling systems; b)on-train systems (eg ERTMS/ETCS equipment, balise readers, GPS etc).[END]
There is a requirement that the EIRENE system can be used as a bearer to support an application connected to the radio for exchange of text messages between ground and mobile(s) or mobile and ground.[END]
The aim of this section is to define the features and level of performance required for this service in order to ensure interoperability.[END]
There is no requirement for an internationally standard is pre-defined messaging application. However, it is anticipated that individual national railways may have a requirement for pre-defined messages, in which case the application should be specified as part of individual national procurements.[END]
It should be possible to transfer text messages between ground and mobile(s) through the EIRENE system.[END]
In order to ensure interoperability, the service is optional for the ground and mandatory for the Cab radio.[END]
If a message is safety related, the safety mechanisms will be included at the application level and do not concern the EIRENE system.[END]
The maximum length of a message segment shall be 96 characters. A message can include several segments.[END]
The transfer time for each message segment should be less then 30 seconds for 95% of messages.[END]
The text message facility shall not interfere with the ability of users to use the radio.[END]
A standard data interface between the mobile and the application module shall be provided.[END]
This section covers the use of the EIRENE radio system for Railway emergency calls. This section also describes the facility for confirmation of such emergency calls and storage of confirmation for post-incident analysis.[END]
This section describes the handling of high priority voice calls for railway operational emergencies and does not cover public emergency calls (ie handling of 112 calls).[END]
There are two types of Railway emergency call: -Train emergency call; -Shunting emergency call.[END]
The type of call initiated shall be determined automatically, based upon the mode of operation of the radio.[END]
If the mobile is in shunting mode, the emergency call button shall initiate a shunting emergency call, otherwise the call shall be a Train emergency call.[END]
The Train emergency call shall be sent to all drivers and controller(s) within an area, which is pre-defined to meet operational requirements. The predefined areas for emergency calls shall include, where necessary, parts of one or more network(s).[END]
The appropriate ERTMS/ETCS RBC should be informed when a Train emergency call is initiated.[END]
The Shunting emergency call shall be sent to all users involved in shunting operations in the shunting area.[END]
The Shunting emergency call shall automatically take priority over the link assurance signal.[END]
A Railway emergency call may be defined in three distinct phases. These are: -Stage 1: Warning; -Stage 2: Information; -Stage 3: Terminate Railway emergency call.[END]
A Railway emergency call shall be able to be initiated by using a simple MMI action (eg a single MMI action for the Cab and Operational radios).[END]
A connection of Railway emergency priority (see section 10.2) shall be established to a pre-determined set of receiving mobiles and controller(s).[END]
If the system is not able to connect the call, the system shall automatically keep trying to connect the call for 30 seconds.[END]
During this period the user shall be provided with an audible and visual indication that the system is trying to connect the call.[END]
After the 30 second period, if the connection was unsuccessful, the system shall provide another audible and visual indication that it was unable to connect the call.[END]
An audible indication of 5 seconds (to be confirmed by trials) shall be provided to originating and receiving users that the emergency function has been activated.[END]
Different indications at the originating and receiving terminal may be provided.[END]
A continuous visual indication that the emergency function has been activated shall be provided at the originating and all receiving terminals.[END]
In the event that a train enters the affected area after the warning stage is complete, the same audible and visual indications shall be provided.[END]
A speech connection shall be established immediately following the warning tone, to allow the originator of the emergency call, to give information concerning the nature of the emergency.[END]
Speech should be possible to allow a controller receiving the warning tone to give information.[END]
Additionally, speech should be possible to allow other mobile users receiving the warning tone to give information.[END]
The information shall be received by the same set of users who received the warning tone.[END]
A Railway emergency call may only be terminated by: -the originator of the call; -a controller participating in the call; -the network following a (nationally determined) period of no speech.[END]
If the radio moves out of the area whilst the emergency call is in progress, an audible and visual indication of the loss of the call shall be provided to the user.[END]
Authorised EIRENE mobiles shall be able to receive a Railway emergency call at anytime while the mobile is powered up.[END]
For Railway emergency calls initiated by a mobile, the controllers display will indicate: -location; -the functional identity of the originating mobile, which includes the following: -the train number, if available; -the engine number, if no train number is available; -the coach number of the leading cab, if neither a train number nor an enginenumber is available.[END]
For post-incident analysis, it is important that the origination and reception of Railway emergency calls by mobiles is confirmed by a message sent to a ground-based centrallocation (and also recorded in the on-train recording device).[END]
The confirmation shall be generated automatically without input from the user.[END]
The confirmation message shall commence at the end of the call or if the radio moves out of the call area.[END]
If the radio loses contact with the network, the mechanism shall commence as soon as possible on regaining communications, for up to a maximum of 5 minutes without achieving contact.[END]
For Railway emergency calls initiated by a mobile, the automatic confirmation message of the initiating mobile shall contain: -the time at call establishment; -the time at clear down; -the functional number of the call originator; -the train number and engine number of the call originator, if a train.[END]
For Railway emergency calls received by a mobile, the automatic confirmation message of the receiving mobile shall contain: -the time at which the call was first received; -the time at which the call was lost (or terminated); -the group identity of the sender; -the functional number of the recipient; -the train number and engine number of the recipient, if a train.[END]
The confirmation message shall be received at the central location with a 99% probability of success within 5 minutes of call termination.[END]
The performance of the confirmation procedure shall not be dependent upon the current use of the mobile and shall not overload the network.[END]
Shunting mode is the term used to describe the application that will regulate and control user access to facilities and features in the mobile while it is being used for shunting communications.[END]
There is a requirement to regulate the membership of shunting groups to prevent uncontrolled membership.[END]
During specific shunting operations where the driver is not able to see the way ahead and where he is therefore relying on information from another shunting member, a link assurance signal is needed to provide reassurance during silent periods that the radio link is still established. This signal is also employed to provide reassurance that this other shunting member is not incapacitated.[END]
The shunting call shall be a group call and shall have Railway operation priority (see section 10.2).[END]
Through out the duration of the shunting group call, it shall be possible for any member of the shunting group to speak to all other members of the group, using the PTT function, except during transmission of the link assurance signal.[END]
During the transmission of the link assurance signal, only the originator of the link assurance signal shall be able to speak to all other members using the PTT function.[END]
The shunting communication shall be protected from unintentional and unauthorised access.[END]
It shall be possible for all mobile members of the shunting group (except the driver) to transmit a link assurance signal.[END]
Within the shunting group, it shall be possible for only one member of the group to transmit the link assurance signal at any time.[END]
Operational radios used for shunting shall enable the link assurance signal to be activated and de-activated by the shunting group member.[END]
The link assurance signal should be used to reassure the driver of the integrity of the member at the head of the shunting movement.[END]
Operational radios used for shunting shall be able to be switched between the following two operating modes by a maintenance function: -Mode 1: the member is required to continuously press the link assurance signal button in order to transmit the link assurance signal; -Mode 2: the member is required to switch on the link assurance signal and then periodically press a button in order to transmit the link assurance signal (failure to do so shall result in the deactivation of the link assurance signal after a predefined period has elapsed).[END]
The link assurance signal shall be used to provide an audible indication to all group members. For the driver, this indicates that the radio link is operational.[END]
It shall be possible for any member of the shunting group (including a driver) to transmit a shunting emergency call to all shunting groups in the area.[END]
It shall be possible for all shunting drivers and shunting group members to receive a shunting emergency call from any equipment capable of taking part in shunting communications. The shunting emergency call shall cause the audible link assurance signal to be interrupted.[END]
It should be possible for the system to record: -shunting group composition at a given instant; -the source and time a shunting emergency call was transmitted; -the recipients of a shunting emergency call.[END]
If a user, other than the shunting leader, attempts to make another call whilst being an active member of a shunting group, the attempt shall be ignored.[END]
If the radio is used by the team leader for a shunting group call (ie initiated the shunting group call), switching the radio off shall result in the termination of the shunting group call.[END]
A shunting group shall be able to consist of the following mobile members: -the shunting leader; -the shunting driver, who may remain fixed (ie in a shunting area) or may change one or more times during a working period (ie passenger or freight stations); -up to three shunting team members.[END]
In addition to the above shunting group members: -a controller shall be able to be associated permanently or temporarily with the shunting group; -a shunting manager or other person capable of taking part in a shunting communication should be able to be temporarily associated with the shunting group.[END]
It shall only be possible for the shunting leader to communicate with a person external to the ongoing shunting communication. This may be initiated by either the shunting leader or the external user. In the latter case, in order to avoid disturbing a shunting movement, the shunting leader should be informed by a visual and audible indication. The shunting leader can then choose the moment when he takes or rejects the call.[END]
The shunting leader shall then be able to allow the external user to join the shunting communication.[END]
National railways will be responsible for limiting the availability of equipment that is capable of taking part in shunting communications to persons that are authorised to engage in such communications.[END]
The link assurance signal is a means to provide end-to-end confirmation between users that a voice communication link remains intact. This facility is required principally for the safe conduct of pushing manoeuvres to assure continuing availability of the radio channel while a shunting worker is guiding a train driver.[END]
The link assurance signal shall consist of an intermittent audio tone (between 800 and 850Hz).The tone shall be of one second duration, followed by an interval of two seconds.[END]
In order to fulfil the requirements of some railways, it should be possible to provide an alternative means of link assurance indication.[END]
This means will consist of an additional safety device (external to the radio system) interposed between the Cab radio and the loudspeaker with the purpose of muting the continuous link assurance signal for the drivers convenience. In this case, the safety device will alert the driver only if the link assurance signal has failed or if it is cancelled.[END]
Operational radios used for shunting shall be able to be switched between thefollowing two operating modes by a maintenance function: -Mode A: the link assurance signal shall be interrupted, but not cancelled, when the initiator of the link assurance signal presses the PTT to speak; -Mode B: the link assurance signal shall not be interrupted when the initiator of the link assurance signal presses the PTT to speak.[END]
The link assurance signal shall be deactivated upon receipt of a shunting emergency call.[END]
All members of the shunting group, other than the initiator of the link assurance signal, shall be unable to speak during the transmission of the link assurance signal. However, they shall be able to initiate a shunting emergency call at any time.[END]
Operating flexibility: it shall be possible to modify a shunting groups composition during a working period. The process for acceptance (or rejection) of new members, and for admission and removal of temporary members, shall be simple.[END]
Management flexibility: in a given area, a radio set shall be capable of operation in any of the shunting groups in use in that area, subject to any user access restrictions.[END]
The operational requirement for direct mode is to: provide short range fall-back communications between train drivers and trackside personnel in the event of failure of mobile telephony services normally available; -provide short range communications for railway personnel operating in remote areas where no mobile telephony facilities are available.[END]
Implementation of direct mode is optional. Where the facility is provided, the following requirements are mandatory.[END]
