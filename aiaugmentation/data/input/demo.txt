The MicroPython Virtual Machine shall be qualified with requirements of ECSS CAT-B, as defined in [AD02] and [AD03].[SEP][END]
The fmax and fmaxf procedures shall determine the maximum numeric value of the argument x and y.[SEP]This includes Â±Inf, with -Inf being lesser than any other numeric value and +Inf being greater than any other numeric value. [END]
The log and logf procedures shall return Not a Number, if the argument x is Not a Number.[END]
The system shall have a procedure to terminate the system.[END]
The exp and expf procedures shall calculate the base eexponential value of their argument x.[END]
The MicroPython cross-compiler shall be designed to produce a bytecode with a minimal size.[SEP]This requirement impacts also the design  and performance of MicroPython Virtual Machine.  Possible solutions can be found in [RD01] (chapter 4).[END]
The ceil and ceilf procedures shall compute the smallest integral value not less than argument x.[END]
The MicroPython language shall support object-orientation, as defined in Python 3.4[SEP]The object-orientation allows using the" templa te method" design pattern to enforce a common structure and execution logic.  The idea is to define once for all an abstract class with methods for the different bodies ( e.g. precondition, main, confirmation, contingency);  these methods have a default empty implementation ; the actual class inherits the abstract one and overloads the required methods.[END]
Basic mathematical Library Test Suite shall check the communication with the target (through GDB) by using checksums on transferred packets and it shall implement retry management.[END]
After being loaded in memory, the byte code generated by the MicroPython cross-compiler shall be executable by the MicroPython Virtual Machine, with the semantic specified by the MicroPython source script.[SEP]See 190[END]
