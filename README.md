# Overview

This repository contains source code to augment natural language requirements through four different methods. These methods are
- [Easy-Data-Augmentation](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1670/)
- Locally fine-tuned GPT-2 model
- [Fairseq language model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq)
- [Parrot Paraphraser](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot_Paraphraser)

## Folder structure
The folder is divided into two projects.
aiaugmentation contains the implementation of the different model interfaces used to augment the given requirements.
aiaugmentation_evaluation contains the evaluation tools used during the experiment.

## Installation
Installment requirements and instructions on how to use can be found in the README.md documents located in the corresponding project folders.
It is not necessary to download additional packages for the aiaugmentation_evaluation project, if the installment of the aiaugmentation project has been successfully completed.

## Dependencies
Warning! Fairseq is incompatible on windows OS. It is required to use OS systems based on Linux, such as MacOS
